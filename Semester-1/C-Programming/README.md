# C Programming Lab – Semester 1 (VTU)

This folder contains the **First Semester C Programming Laboratory** programs under the VTU curriculum.  
All programs are written in a clean and readable format with proper logic, meaningful variable names, and comment explanations.  

I will continue improving this repository as I learn better logic and practices throughout my engineering journey.

## 📌 Notes
- These programs follow the **standard VTU lab cycle**.
- Logic is written to be **clear and understandable**, not just to pass compilation.
- This repository will be **updated continuously** as I progress through engineering.
